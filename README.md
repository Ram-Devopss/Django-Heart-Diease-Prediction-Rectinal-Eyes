**Title**: Heart Prediction Using Retinal Eyes  

**Description**:  
This project aims to quantify heart attack risk using retinal image processing and a decision tree algorithm. Built with Python and Django, it provides a web-based interface where users can upload retinal images to predict heart disease risk. The project incorporates key features such as data acquisition, preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training to ensure accurate predictions.  

**Features**:  
- **Data Acquisition**: Upload and manage retinal images for analysis.  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Enhance and normalize retinal images for better feature extraction.  
- **Feature Extraction**: Identify key patterns in retinal images linked to heart disease.  
- **Heart Disease Risk Prediction**: Use a decision tree algorithm to assess the likelihood of heart disease.  
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and signup functionality using Django.  
- **User Dashboard**: View prediction results and manage uploaded images.  

**Tech Stack**:  
- **Backend**: Python, Django  
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Machine Learning**: Decision Tree Algorithm  
- **Database**: SQLite (default, replaceable with other databases)  

This repository is ideal for students and professionals interested in healthcare applications, machine learning, and web development.
